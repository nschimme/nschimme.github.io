<p>I own a <a href="http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Z87PRO/">ASUS Z87 Pro</a> and an <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/75048/Intel-Core-i5-4670K-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_80-GHz">Intel 4670K</a> that I&rsquo;ve overclocked to a respectable 4.4 GHz which had started exhibiting problems. I noticed a few weeks ago that the bus speed was fluctuating between 95-99 MHz by looking at it with <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html">CPU-Z</a>.</p>
<p>I orginally believed that this was happening due to an imminant motherboard death. In attempts to debug the problem I had:</p>
<ol><li>Increased input voltage to 1.9v</li>
<li>Decreased/increase uncore multiplier</li>
<li>Changed CPU multipliers</li>
<li>Increased/decreased voltage</li>
<li>Force BCLK to 100 Mhz</li>
<li>Disabled/enabled spread spectrum</li>
<li>RMA&rsquo;d my motherboard to ASUS</li>
</ol><p>Oddly, the problem only exhibited itself when I was overclocked because the behavior disappeared when I reset to BIOS factory default settings. In truth, the issue was because I had Hyper-V installed on my Windows 8 machine!</p>
<p>I discovered this after I disabled Virtualization support in the BIOS and noticed that the fluctuations stopped. After that, I uninstalled Hyper-V, re-enabled Virtualization support, and everything has been fine since then. I&rsquo;m now just going to use VirtualBox for my VM needs since it doesn&rsquo;t cause the same problems.</p>
<p>It seems like a bunch of other people have noticed this:</p>

</ol><p>It looks like this is just a Hyper-V/hardware problem. It seems like Microsoft is doing some weird things with C and P-states to attain energy efficiency with SpeedStep:</p>

</ol><p>Oh, and I&rsquo;ve now sent ASUS my debugging analysis so we&rsquo;ll see what comes out of that.</p>
