I am traveling to Scandinavia today, and I really wanted one place that I could store everything and beautifully display it at the same time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my local Synology box is too low end to host it all and my home internet just canâ€™t cope with more than a few viewers. This left only a few cloud based options such as Dropbox, Picasa, and Flickr among others. However, only Flickr provided 1TB of storage for free as well as providing a rich API for hackers.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/trickortweak/flickr-uploader">flickr-uploader</a>, an open source script that syncs your folders into albums automagically. Set it up on your Synology, forget it, and everything just works.</p>

<p>Give it a shot! :-)</p>
