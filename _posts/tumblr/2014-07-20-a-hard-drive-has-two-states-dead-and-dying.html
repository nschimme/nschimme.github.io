<blockquote>A hard drive has two states: dead and dying</blockquote>&#8212;<figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="519" class="tmblr-full"><img src="tumblr_files/tumblr_inline_nn6xy2ezuk1rkukje_500.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="519"/></figure><p>My oldest hard drive is giving its last death rattle in the form of ever more common clicks. It is still working&hellip; but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s days are numbered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve backed up all the data from the clicker drive and now started an experiment. I&rsquo;ve placed this drive and another semi-clicker into a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/storage-spaces-pools">ReFS mirrored storage space</a> on my Windows 8 desktop. Write performance immediately tanked from 140MBps to 45MBps similar to <a href="http://homeservershow.com/storage-spaces-performance-in-windows-server-2012-essentials-on-a-hp-n40l-proliant-microserver.html">what people have complained about before</a> but otherwise I haven&rsquo;t noticed any major problems.</p>
<p>Will my data survive? I&rsquo;m planning on adding another working drive to the array just to hedge my bets&hellip;</p>
