<p>Today, judging by the nearly 7 million views it has garnered since it debuted on YouTube, the news story that is apparently at the top of everyone’s minds boils down to one fascinating idea: Hamsters. And how the heck they manage to get an entire burrito into those adorable little cheek pouches. Set to a lively classical score, “Tiny Hamsters Eating Tiny Burritos” may have gone viral because it hits us right in the feels: an adorable, pocket-sized pet is treated to a lavish — by hamster standards — meal, prepared lovingly by a chef whose fondest wish is that his furry customer give his homemade burrito the thumbs-up, if only hamsters had thumbs.</p>
