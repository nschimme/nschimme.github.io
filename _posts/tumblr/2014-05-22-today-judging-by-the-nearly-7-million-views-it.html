Set to a lively classical score, “Tiny Hamsters Eating Tiny Burritos” may have gone viral because it hits us right in the feels: an adorable, pocket-sized pet is treated to a lavish — by hamster standards — meal, prepared lovingly by a chef whose fondest wish is that his furry customer give his homemade burrito the thumbs-up, if only hamsters had thumbs.</p>
