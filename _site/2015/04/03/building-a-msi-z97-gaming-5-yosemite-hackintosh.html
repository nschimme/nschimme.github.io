<!-- more --><hr><p><b>Step 1) Purchasing the Right Hardware</b><br/></p><p>I’ve tried building a hackintosh in the past but was always stricken by incompatibility errors that resulted in kernel crashes similar to the dread blue screen of death. The happens because Apple has complete control of the hardware and software stack, and because of that takes a lot of hardware features for granted. If your hardware isn’t exactly compatible, then you need to hack the low-level BIOS software (usually using a DSDT patch) to try to make it compatible with OS X. This is as painful as it sounds so its significantly easier just to buy the right hardware in the first place. Luckily TonyMacX86 as great guides that list out <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/building-customac-buyers-guide-march-2015.html">which hardware</a> is best supported but I still needed to buy this hardware and convince myself that the project was worth the cost.</p><p>Luckily, I knew of <a href="http://slickdeals.net/f/7720487-microcenter-msi-z97-gaming-5-free-after-rebate-with-purchase-of-i5-4690k-or-i7-4790k-b-m?v=1">Slickdeals</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/2yn2hp/mobo_msi_z97_gaming_5_motherboard_free_with/">/r/buildapcsales</a>, which led me to a<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/2yn2hp/mobo_msi_z97_gaming_5_motherboard_free_with/"> great deal </a>on a <a href="http://www.msi.com/product/mb/Z97-GAMING-5.html#hero-specification">MSI Z97-Gaming 5 motherboard</a> and <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/80811/Intel-Core-i5-4690K-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_90-GHz">Intel 4690K Core i5 processor</a> combination that also was highly compatible for hackintoshes per the TonyMacX86 hardware guide. If you’re in the market to buy a PC, I strongly urge you to start subscribing to this subreddit for deals. I have found numerous enabling deals  that provoked me to embark projects such as my foray into water cooling (which I’ll write on a post later).</p><p>In the end, I purchased the following parts to complete some of spares that I already had from my workstation. The Crucial BX100 SSD was selected because of its excellent price/performance ratio and the history of its bigger brother the MX100. I selected the older <a href="http://gpushack.com/collections/all-gpus-for-sale/products/his-iceq-hd-7950-boost">Radeon 7950 video card</a> for my build because widely known to be compatible in hackintoshes and still provides plenty of punch for gaming (so much that it was branded as the R9 280 and is still widely sold). I highly recommend <a href="http://gpushack.com/">gpuShack </a>for your video card purchase since you’ll get a great price and an awesome warranty. Lastly, the TP-Link wireless card was recommended on TonyMac for its native wireless support and having used non-native wireless USB cards I can easily attest that its well worth it.<br/></p><p><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i54690k">Intel Core i5-4690K 3.5GHz Quad-Core Processor</a><br/><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-motherboard-z97gaming5">MSI Z97-GAMING 5 ATX LGA1150 Motherboard</a><br/><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-internal-hard-drive-ct250bx100ssd1">Crucial BX100 250GB 2.5&quot; Solid State Drive</a><br/><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/part/his-video-card-h795qc3g2m">HIS Radeon HD 7950 3GB Video Card</a><br/><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/part/tp-link-wireless-network-card-tlwdn4800">TP-Link TL-WDN4800 802.11a/b/g/n PCI-Express x1 Wi-Fi Adapter</a></p>

<hr><p><b>Step 2) Configuring the BIOS</b><br/></p><p>
You need to setup the BIOS so that it is Mac compatible. To access UEFI Setup, press and hold Delete on a USB Keyboard while the system is booting up.
</p><p>
Perform the following commands:
</p><ol><li>Settings - Save &amp; Exit - Restore Defaults.</li>
<li>OC Settings - CPU Features - Disable Intel VT-d</li>
<li>OC Settings - CPU Features - Disable CFG lock</li>
<li>Save and exit.
</li></ol><hr><p><b>Step 3) Installing the OS</b><br/></p><p>For installing the Mac OS X I first followed <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/yosemite-desktop-guides/143976-unibeast-install-os-x-yosemite-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html">the official guide on TonyMacX86</a> to create the installation USB stick. After having that, I followed the <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/yosemite-desktop-guides/144426-how-install-os-x-yosemite-using-clover.html">Clover guide</a> to install everything. If you follow the instructions you shouldn’t have too much trouble.</p><p>However, in the end I had to apply the following additional fixes. Most of these fixes are distilled from this dated <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/2bvggr/hack_complete_4790k_z97_780ti_a_bit_of_a/">reddit post</a> and <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/user-builds/158358-success-msi-z97-gaming-5-i5-4690k-clover.html">forum post</a> to which I owe a lot.
