<meta name="description" content="I own a ASUS Z87 Pro and an Intel 4670K that I&rsquo;ve overclocked to a respectable 4.4 GHz which had started exhibiting problems. I noticed a few weeks ago that the bus speed was fluctuating between 95-99 MHz by looking at it with CPU-Z. I orginally believed that this was happening due to an imminant motherboard death. In attempts to debug the problem I had: Increased input voltage to 1.9v Decreased/increase uncore multiplier Changed CPU multipliers Increased/decreased voltage Force BCLK to 100 Mhz Disabled/enabled spread spectrum RMA&rsquo;d my motherboard to ASUS Oddly, the problem only exhibited itself when I was overclocked because the behavior disappeared when I reset to BIOS factory default settings. In truth, the issue was because I had Hyper-V installed on my Windows 8 machine! I discovered this after I disabled Virtualization support in the BIOS and noticed that the fluctuations stopped. After that, I uninstalled Hyper-V, re-enabled Virtualization support, and everything has been fine since then. I&rsquo;m now just going to use VirtualBox for my VM needs since it doesn&rsquo;t cause the same problems.
